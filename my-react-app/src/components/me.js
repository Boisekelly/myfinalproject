    <h1>I am the quintessential cat lady. I share my home with 5 wonderful kitties whom I adopted. Ragu and Pretty came to me from a 
        shelter after their owner went into hospice. Molly's owner arrived from the same shelter after her owner was forced into assisted 
        living. Daisy and Alli's owner died and I was their petsitter while she was in the hospital and in home-hospice, so naturally I took
        them in. With 5 cats there is lots of love, as well as drama and work. It is certainly never boring, though.
